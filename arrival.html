                <h2>Arrival (2016)</h2>
                <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Science Fiction, Drama</p>
                <p><strong>Director:</strong> Denis Villeneuve</p>
                <p><strong>Cast:</strong> Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker</p>
                <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> When mysterious alien spacecraft land on Earth, linguist Dr. Louise Banks is recruited to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors. As she deciphers their language, she begins to uncover secrets that challenge her perception of time, fate, and human existence.</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> *Arrival* is a deeply philosophical and emotional sci-fi film that goes beyond the typical alien-invasion narrative. Denis Villeneuve’s direction, combined with Amy Adams’ stunning performance, creates an introspective experience about language, memory, and the choices we make. The film’s non-linear storytelling and haunting score elevate it to a masterpiece of modern science fiction.</p>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)</p>
